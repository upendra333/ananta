                        <p>Every time you visit our website, we may gather certain information in an effort to improve it, The server logs may contain such data.

However, they do not individually identify you. This information may include your IP address, the type of browser you are using (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera, Google Chrome, etc.), your computer's operating system, and the website you last visited before coming to our website. Along with the date and time of your access, the session also stores how long you spent on our website. Ananta Mobility LLP uses these details to comprehend how and how many people use the website.</p>
